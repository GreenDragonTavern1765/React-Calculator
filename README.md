# Calculator Web-Application in React (JavaScript Framework)
The purpose of this project is to practice and get familiar using React for an upcoming capstone project.
This is a basic calculator web-application on the React JavaScript framework, and is being developed using 
WebStorm, a JetBrains JavaScript IDE. Throughout the development of this web-application, activities will be
logged using this README.MD file as documentation for the process itself, and will be updated with each commit
to Github.com using the resources available from an online YouTube tutorial on the React environment.
